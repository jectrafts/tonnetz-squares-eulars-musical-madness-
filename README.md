ðŸ“– What is a Tonnetz?
The Tonnetz (German for "tone network") is a grid-like diagram used in music theory to show relationships between musical pitches â€” especially in terms of harmony and chord structure.

ðŸŽ¹ How do Tonnetz squares work?
Each square (or button) on the grid represents a musical note.

Notes are arranged so that adjacent squares have strong harmonic relationships:

Moving horizontally â†’ perfect fifth interval (e.g., C to G)

Moving vertically â†’ major third (e.g., C to E)

Moving diagonally â†’ minor third (e.g., C to Eâ™­)
